# Portfolio_EirikGjeruldsen
This Github repository is to show what I have created since I started programming in late 2015.

Projects done during the timespand August 2015 - June 2018 was done during my bachelor in Game Techologies and Simulation.

I am currently working on learning new languages, which will be added once I have completed relevant projects.
Here is a list of fields I want / have started to explore:
Python (Machine learning)
Java (Android development)
JavaScript / HTML (Fullstack development).

Currently enrolled in Ã˜stfold University College, doing my master in Applied Computer Science.
Where I am hoping to learn how to implement machine learning into fields I find interesting.
