In this folder I have grabbed a couple of the scripts used in the game engine created in C++ and OpenGL in my 5th semester during my bachelor in Game technology and simulation.

Comments on functionality can be found in the HEADER-files.

QT-libraries have been used.
QT- UI has been used to visualize the GUI elements.

This results in the code not being able to run, cause dependant scripts are not included.

If you want to see some of the results from the code, some of it will be contained within this YouTube video:
