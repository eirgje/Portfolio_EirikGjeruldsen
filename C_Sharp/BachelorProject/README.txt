-Nordavind- 

Using the Unity engine we created the game Nordavind as our bachelor project.
The game can be found here: https://neon-peon.itch.io/nordavind.

This project was coded together with Dexter André Osiander (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexter-andr%C3%A9-osiander-b1819415b/).


Due to this being a small team I had to do a little bit of everything, but my main task was to create the enemy behavior.

Due to overscoping (project being to big) we had to make some quick choices to make the game work, which led us to do a couple of faster solutions. Therefore some of the code might seem a little messy.
